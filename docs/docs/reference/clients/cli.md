title: Command line interface
---

The DataCap CLI provides a terminal-based, interactive shell for running queries. The CLI is a self-executing JAR file, which means it acts like a normal UNIX executable.

### Requirements

---

The CLI requires a Java virtual machine available on the path. It can be used with Java version 8 and higher.

The CLI uses the DataCap client REST API over HTTP/HTTPS to communicate with the system.

The CLI version should be identical to the version of system, or newer.

### Installation

---

Download [datacap-client-cli-1.6.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/edurt/datacap/datacap-client-cli/1.6.0/datacap-client-cli-1.6.0.jar), rename it to datacap, make it executable with `chmod +x`.

### Running the CLI

---

```bash
./datacap

connect -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9096 -u username -P password
```

If successful, you will get a prompt to execute commands. Use the `help` command to see a list of supported commands.
